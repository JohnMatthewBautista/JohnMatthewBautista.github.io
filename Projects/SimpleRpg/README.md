# Simple Rpg

## What is it?
It is an html game that features classic gba like controls for mobile, and uses wasd control scheme on pc. This is one of my largest personal projects using javascript and jquery. All the designs and controls were originally written by me.

## Tutorial
The game is designed as a 2.5d environment limited to left and right directions. It has a semi turn based movement. 
__ps. click one at a time__

+ Starting the game
 Approach the npc and choose a weapon, then proceed by pressing A at the door to leave the house. Use A (K in keyboard) to interact and skip a turn. Use B (or L) to activate attacks

+ Weapon Types 
Every 'move' or click allows the player to attack but the different weapons have some characteristics :
	- "Spear = Has a range of 2 with 10 damage.
	- Sword = Can swing twice in a turn with 15 damage.
	- Hammer = Deals 20 damage

+ Beating the game 
Defeat and clear the slimes completely, but beware the slimes can multiply and their health increases as more of them gets killed. The slimes can attack you when you move infornt of them or they approach you. The winning condition is clearing all the slimes before more of them spawn. Or trying to survive the longest possible.

+ This game is not very intuitive but here are some tips:
	- Avoid moving towards the enemy and bait them.
	- The Mc changes color as it sustains damage.
	- Auto attacks happen when you move away from the enemy (up/down).

 **Have fun!! (as much fun as this game can be)**
