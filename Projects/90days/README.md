# 90 day counter

# Background
My first personal project that utilised my skills in html and javascript. 

# Purpose
This is a simple widget to count up to ninety, illustrated via a large canvas that forms the numerical symbol '90' comprised of small squares. The squares are filled with color to represent the number upto 90 which completely fills the illustration.

Its main purpose is a 90 day counter or equivalent to three months. This is used for observing habits or reaching goals. Currently this html widget does not store the data or amount of days permanently.
